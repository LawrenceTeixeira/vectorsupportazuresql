## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Azure OpenAI with Native Vector Support in Azure SQL Database to enable advanced search capabilities. By combining vector embeddings with SQLâ€™s traditional query capabilities, you can perform similarity searches, enhance recommendation systems, and integrate semantic understanding into your applications.

Key features include:
- **Vector Embeddings**: Generate and store vector embeddings using Azure OpenAI.
- **Vector Search**: Perform similarity searches within your Azure SQL Database using native vector support.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector search with traditional keyword filtering for enhanced results.

## Installation

To get started, ensure that your environment is properly set up. Follow the steps below to install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Azure SQL Database with Native Vector Support enabled
- Azure OpenAI service with API access

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LawrenceTeixeira/vectorsupportazuresql.git
cd vectorsupportazuresql
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure to install the necessary Python packages. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set up environment variables directly. You'll need the following variables:

```plaintext
AZURE_API_KEY=<Azure API Key>
AZURE_API_BASE=<Azure API Base>
AZURE_API_VERSION=<Azure API Version>
DB_SERVER=<Azure SQL Database Server>
DB_DATABASE=<Azure SQL Database Name>
DB_UID=<Azure SQL Database user>
DB_PWD=<Azure SQL Database passworkd>
```

## Usage

### 1. Updating Vector Fields

If you need to update or insert vector embeddings in your Azure SQL Database table, modify the `app.py` script. This script performs the following tasks:

- Fetches data from your dataset.
- Generates embeddings using Azure OpenAI.
- Converts the embeddings to binary vectors and stores them in Azure SQL Database.

To execute the script, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 2. Running the Streamlit App

The Streamlit app provides an interactive UI to perform searches and view results in real-time. Launch the app with:

```bash
streamlit run search.py
```

## Deploy your app in Fly.io
```sh
flyctl launch
flyctl deploy
```
## Login or Logout at Fly.io
```sh
flyctl auth login
flyctl auth logout
```

## Install fly
```sh
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
export PATH=/home/codespace/.fly/bin
```

This will start the Streamlit server. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

### 3. Example Use Cases

- **Semantic Search**: Enter a query, and the app will search for similar items based on the vector embeddings stored in your database.
- **Recommendation System**: Use vector search to recommend related items based on the semantic similarity of the data.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector search with keyword-based filters to refine your results.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed by checking the `requirements.txt` file.
- **Database Permissions**: Verify that your Azure SQL user has the required permissions to read, write, and execute stored procedures.
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check that your environment variables are correctly set.
